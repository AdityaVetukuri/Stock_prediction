    Description: Use this file to run stock class and all stock methods
    Data: Stock.py will use base directory to load test.csv and train.csv unless specified
        Training Set:
            Size: 169 MB
            Location: If not accessible with blackboard submission, https://cs584.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/train.csv
        Test Set:
            Size: 275 MB
            Location: If not accessible with blackboard submission, https://cs584.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/test.csv

    Use:   To properly run main.py and stock.py data directory must exist in base directory contaiing test.csv and train.csv files.  Uncomment below lines to see pre processing plots, post processing plots, feature selection, data processing, and model evalution.  Calling methods individually will result in automatic sequential execution of necessary methods.  If Stock.py initialized with 'save=True', evaluate_model() automatically saves submission file or can be manually generated by calling save().
